This repository contains my contributions to a manuscript currently in review at mSphere.
In this work, I performed genome-wide motif searches for the known bindings motifs of Aspergillus nidulans transcription factors brlA and abaA.

Our previous work implicates brlA, the "master regulator" of asexual reproduction in nidulans, as an actor in the cell wall stress response.
Thus, we used motif search to identify genes putatively controlled by brlA, and used two independent RNAseq datasets to identify which of these genes were involved in cell wall stress reponse but NOT involved in asexual reproduction.

The paper preprint linked above describes the process, and our confirmatory experimentation after finding a group of six transmembrane transporters in this dataset.
